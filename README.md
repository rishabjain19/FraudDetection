    Frontend: HTML,CSS
    Backend: Flask (Python)
    Database: SQLite3 (Central to trigger implementation)
    


Key Database Features: The application relies on advanced DBMS concepts for reliability:
    Triggers: Ensure instant fraud checks upon data entry.
    Indexes: Optimize query performance on user and time columns.
    Views: Simplify reporting on suspicious transactions.


Setup in Three Steps:
    1.  Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
    2.  Initialize the database: python db_init.py
    3.  Run the application: python app.py
